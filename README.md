# clock-divider

Based on XEM7310-A75 FPGA, user can input the frequency, duty cycle and phase shift they want, and the expected clock will be output from test-IO.

This can be used as a controllable Laser modulator that can output six laser modulation signals with different frequency, duty cycle and phase shifting from FPGA(XEM7310-A75), customized through Python UI.â€‹
